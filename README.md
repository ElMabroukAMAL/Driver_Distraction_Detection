## Overview of the Approach

The following steps outline the process followed in this study:

### Steps:

#### Data Description & Analysis
- **Source**: State Farm Distracted Driver Dataset  
- **Classes**: 10 types of distractions (texting, talking, drinking, etc.)  
- **Preprocessing**: Resizing, normalization, and augmentation  

#### Model Selection & Implementation
- **Baseline Dense Model**  
- **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**  
- **ResNet50**  

#### Performance Analysis
- **Comparative study of model accuracy**  
- **Visualization of classification results**  
- **Final model selection based on metrics**
